# Captcha_Solver_CNN

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based captcha solver using OpenCV (cv2) library. The solver is trained to recognize and classify characters in captcha images.

Results:

On Training Data -> loss: 2.0184e-06 - accuracy: 1.0000 - val_loss: 1.3061 - val_accuracy: 0.8949 (at last epoch)

Test Data on .evaluate() -> loss: 1.6563516855239868 - accuracy: 0.8783910274505615

5 Random images .predict() -> 5/5

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV (cv2) library
- Keras library
